## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera’s testnet** to deploy smart contracts. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for the following reasons:

- **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- **GitHub Project**: We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the GitHub project management tool.
- **Implementing the CI/CD workflow**: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- **Using PRs and Issues**: We are doing multiple PRs and building multiple issues to keep on track of the project.

## 🖥 Replit

We have deployed our project on Replit. Replit is a cloud-based IDE that allows you to code in 50+ programming languages without having to install anything on your computer. It is a great tool for developers to collaborate and build projects.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Implementing the Hedera was a challange but we learned and buils it.
- It was the first time we all used Hedera Hashgraph, so we had to learn how to use it.
- Due to the difference in time zones, it was difficult to communicate with each other.
- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project in a deadline.
